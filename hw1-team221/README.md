# Homework 1

There is *only one* part to this homework. You will write a shell script that implements a file system trash bin. In all homeworks, each part will have an instructions.md file which explains what you need to do. For this homework, the instructions can be found under

	instructions.md

All your changes must be done under the `src` directory. ***You should not modify any directory or file names. You should not submit any additional files other than what is provided.***

All submissions must include at least five git commits (total) with meaningful messages.

## Submission

To submit:

    git commit -am "hw1 completed"
	git tag -a handin -m "hw1 submission"
	git push origin main
	git push origin handin
